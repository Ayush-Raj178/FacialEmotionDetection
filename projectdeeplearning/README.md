# 🎭 Facial Emotion Detection System using CNN

A deep learning–based facial emotion detection system built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** with **Keras**, integrated with **OpenCV** for real-time face detection.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project detects and classifies human facial expressions into different emotions like **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprised**, etc. It uses:
- A CNN model built and trained using Keras
- Haarcascade classifier from OpenCV for face detection
- Python script for live webcam or static image inference

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayush-Raj178/Project.git
cd Project
\`\`\`

### 2. Create & Activate Virtual Environment (Optional)
\`\`\`bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
\`\`\`

### 3. Install Required Libraries
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

*If \`requirements.txt\` is missing, run:*
\`\`\`bash
pip install keras tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib numpy
\`\`\`

## ▶️ How to Use

### 1. Train Model (Optional)
If you want to retrain the model:
- Open \`emotion-classification-cnn-using-keras.ipynb\` in Jupyter Notebook
- Run all cells to train the CNN model
- Save model as \`model.h5\`

### 2. Run Emotion Detection (Live)
\`\`\`bash
python main.py
\`\`\`

- This script will access your webcam.
- It will detect faces using Haarcascade and classify the emotion using the CNN model.

## 😃 Output Example

✅ Real-time webcam detection  
✅ Bounding box around face  
✅ Label for predicted emotion (e.g., Happy, Sad)

> *Screenshots or demo videos can be added here.*

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
- Train on a larger emotion dataset (e.g., FER-2013)
- Add support for image upload
- Visualize emotion probability heatmaps
